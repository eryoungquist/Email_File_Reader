# Email_File_Reader
In this project for Python Data Structures I worked with tuples,lists and other methods to scan a file of email correspondance to find when the largest amount of emails are sent. With the original file the code spits out:
04 3
06 1
07 1
09 2
10 3
11 6
14 1
15 2
16 4
17 2
18 1
19 1
